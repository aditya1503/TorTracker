# TorTracker
Track websites visited anonymously using Tor
This program uses machine learning to Track websites visited using Tor. 
Although the data is ecnrypted, I explored a few feature engineering techniques that can look for patterns in the packets transmitted.
The code gives around 44% accuracy on the test dataset.
ToDo: We can use Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM to improve the accuracy, and automatically engineer the features.
